title = "Beef Bourguignon"

[ingredients]
1 lbs; boneless beef shoulder or neck (chuck)
; kosher salt (salt)
; fresh ground pepper (pepper)
2 Tbsp; olive oil
2; medium onion (onion)
1 Tbsp; all-purpose flour
1/2 cup; red burgundy wine (wine)
3; medium carrots (carrots)
1 clove; garlic
1 sprig; thyme
1 sprig; italian parsley (parsley)
1; bay leaf
1 Tbsp; demi-glace

[instructions]
Cut chuck into 1 1/2 inch pieces.
Chop parsley.
Pat meat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Generously season with salt & pepper.
In a dutch oven over _high heat_, heat half of the oil until shimmering.
Working in batches sear the meat on all sides until well browned, adding more oil as needed. Once done transfer to plate and set aside.
Reduce heat to _medium-high_ and cook onions in remaining oil, stirring occasionally until soft and golden, about 10 minutes.
Sprinkle the flour on top and cook, stirring occasionally until thick, about 4 or 5 minutes.
Add wine and stir using a wooden spoon, scraping up all browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
When wine starts to boil, return meat and any accumulated juices to the pot.
Then add carrots, garlic, and bouquet garni (parsley, thyme, and bay leaf).
Add 3/4 cups of water and 1 Tbsp demi-glace.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to _medium-low_ heat and cook uncovered until the meat is tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
Checking every 15 to 20 minutes skim off any foam or oil that accumulates on the surface, and scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent scorching or sticking. Continue adding water as needed, up to 2 cups total.
When the stew is done, discard bouquet garni, taste and add salt if desired.
Plate and garnish with chopped parsley.
