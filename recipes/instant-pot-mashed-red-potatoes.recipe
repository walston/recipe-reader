title = "Instant Pot Mashed Red Potatoes"

[ingredients]
1 lbs; red potatoes
1/2 cup; water
2 Tbsp; butter
1 clove; garlic
1/3 cups; half and half, warmed (half & half)
1 1/2 Tbsp; sour cream
; salt
; pepper

[Instructions]
Start by scrubbing the potatoes well and piercing the skin a few times with a fork.
Place potatoes on a steamer rack in Instant Pot and add water to the potatoes.
Cook on HIGH pressure for 20 minutes, then let Instant Pot Natural Pressure release.
Melt butter in a small pan with garlic cloves _while potatoes are cooking_ to infuse butter with garlic. Let sit until potatoes are ready to mash; garlic will continue to flavor the butter as it sits.
Use tongs to carefully remove hot potatoes; remove steam rack and discard water.
Mash potatoes with garlic butter, discarding whole garlic pieces.
Stir in warm half & half.
Stir in sour cream.
Salt & pepper to taste
